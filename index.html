            Hi! My name is Jeff Sherin and I am applying to work at Epic on the iOS team. You can see my resume at the bottom, but first, how I learned about Epic:<br>
            <br>
            <strong>My 7 year old daughter Kaya:</strong> I love Epic! Can you install it on the iPad?<br>
            <strong>Me:</strong> What is Epic?<br>
            <strong>Kaya:</strong> It's a super fun app we have at school, it has all these books in it.<br>
            <strong>Me:</strong> Um ok, let me see<br>
            (Gets iPad -> downloads)<br>
            <strong>Me:</strong> Hmm, this looks really cool! [logs in] Oh wow, you've read all these books?<br>
            <strong>Kaya:</strong> Yea everyone at school loves it. Can I have the iPad now?<br>
            <br>
            So that's how I learned about Epic. And then I saw the job posting on iosDevJobs.com. Is it fate? Destiny? Something is in the air.
            <br><br>
            Just look at my resume (LinkedIn below) and you'll find I have a lot of experience with iOS and would be an asset to the team. I'd love to talk to you about it!
            <br><br>
            Finally, the best way to show you how much everyone loves Epic in our house is for my daughter to tell you herself:
